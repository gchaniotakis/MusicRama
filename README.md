Each song has a title and a small description as well as a date that corresponds to the date it was added to the database. 

In addition it holds a reference to the user that submitted it. 

Users can also express their opinion about a song by either likes or hates. 


When an unregistered user visits the homepage, they see the list of songs that have been added to the system, as well as links for logging in or signing up. Each song contains the following information: 


● Title 


● Description 


● Name of the user 


● Date of publication 


● Number of likes 


● Number of hates 


The name of the user is a link that, when clicked upon, filters the songs down to the items that have been shared by this specific user. The list can also be sorted by the number of likes, number of hates or the publication date. 
In addition to the functionality described above, registered users are able to add their own songs and express their opinion for other songs by either a like or hate. Voting is performed by clicking on the respective counters that are displayed for each song.
